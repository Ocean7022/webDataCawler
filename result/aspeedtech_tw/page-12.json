            "信驊科技董事長林鴻明任清華電機甲組企業導師",
            "2015年7月20日，新竹－清華大學電機工程學系自102年學年度開始舉辦的「看見學分外的世界」活動 已連續舉辦第三屆，104學年度由信驊科技董事長林鴻明先生獲邀擔任甲組新生「企業導師」，希望能「大手牽小手」，提攜學弟妹，讓學生汲取校園外的寶貴職場經驗與知識。",
            "信驊科技由董事長兼總經理林鴻明先生一手創立，目前為全球前三大雲端伺服器管理晶片供應商，也是台灣唯一鎖定雲端伺服器晶片的利基型IC設計公司。回想起創業之初的經驗與甘苦，董事長林鴻明先生認為能夠在這樣孤獨的道路上堅持下去，靠的是紮實的技術基礎與對目標市場的精準掌握，以及自身個性上的毅力與不服輸。",
            "對他來說，在創新求變的過程中所帶來的挑戰與激盪是相當吸引人的，因此他非常樂意將所學所經歷傳承給下一代年輕學子，並希望將「勇於創新，樂於分享」的理念與學生分享，帶領學生涉獵課業之外更廣闊的層面。林鴻明先生表示：「在清大的求學生涯對往後我的職涯發展幫助甚大；因此我很高興能夠有機會擔任第三屆甲組的企業導師，一方面讓我有機會回饋母校及母系多年的培育之恩，另一方面也讓我有機會跟一群優秀的年輕人互動，彼此激盪。我相信這樣的一個特殊任務必定能帶給我豐富的生活體驗跟成長。」",
            "清華電機的企業導師制度，實施兩年以來深獲學生與家長好評。清華電機系甲組首屆企業導師為聯詠科技董事長何泰舜先生，協助指導102學年度入學的甲組學生；去年(103學年度)入學的清華電機甲組學生企業導師則由力旺電子董事長徐清祥先生擔任，今年度將會由信驊科技董事長林鴻明先生帶給學生們更多不同的體驗，期望能順利讓學生們進一步瞭解所學專長在實際產業的應用。",
