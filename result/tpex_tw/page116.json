            "Ans:",
            "ESB is a quote-driven market. The counterparty must be the Recommending Securities Firm (RSF). Thus information publicly disclosed is the ask and bid quotes provided by RSFs. The order information of investors is not supposed to disclose.",
            "Ans:",
            "ESB stocks are traded in a market where price negotiations are driven by quotes offered by RSFs. When an investor trades ESB stocks, one side of the a transaction must be the RSF thereof, and the quote offered by the RSF is the execution price. Therefore, quotes made by RSFs serve as important reference information for investors placing orders. Because TPEx discloses bid/ask quotes made by RSFs at the beginning of trading hours each business day (9:00 A.M.), and the Click System also starts accepting orders at 9:00 A.M., and in order to increase investors’ opportunities of execution, investors are recommended to place orders after bid/ask quotes are disclosed at 9:00 A.M.",

            "Trades of ESB stocks are dominated by bid and ask quotations of RSFs, and one side of a transaction must be the RSF. If the investor’s trading order meets the price quoted (Investor’s buy order ≧ RSF’s ask quote; Investor’s sell order ≦ RSF’s bid quote), the Click System will allocate the order to the RSF with the best quote and automatically facilitate executing. Thus, when investors place orders to buy (sell) ESB stocks, RSFs’ ask(bid) quotes must be taken into consideration ESB stocks in order to increase the chance of execution.",
