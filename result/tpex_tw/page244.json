Briefly, an ETN is an investment tool that acquires index returns by stock trading, allowing small investors to enjoy diversified investment benefits or reduce investment thresholds as an innovative financial product.",

In the primary market, investors can purchase from the securities firm that issues ETN at the time of ETN issuance, and directly purchase the ETN at the issue price. After the ETN is listed, the investor can also purchase or sell the ETN in large amounts to the issuing securities firm through the securities brokers. In addition, investors can also buy and sell ETN through the secondary market. The ETN's price fluctuation limits and tick size for the price are slightly different from the stocks. The ETN’s trading hours and trading methods are the same as the stocks.",

First, like buying and selling stocks, investors can use existing securities trading accounts to entrust securities brokers to place orders and settle them on the second business day after the closing date. Second, investors can apply to the issuing securities firm through the securities broker to buy or sell back ETN, just as the investor purchases the fund, but there is a certain restriction on the number of ETN if investors choose this way. Investor should read carefully the ETN prospectus.",

In principle, the formula for calculating the value of the indicator is as follows. However, the value of the indicator of the ETN designed by each securities firm will be slightly different. For the calculation method of the index value of each ETN, please refer to the ETN prospectus.",
